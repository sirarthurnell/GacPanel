# GacPanel
Tool for updating a server's GAC from a client machine.

It's a web application developed using ASP.NET WebForms that lets the user check the GAC of the server where it is deployed.

It lets the user change the GAC uploading assemblies from the client machine, deleting them and even read and modify the binging directives for those assemblies that have them. It checks the version of the assemblies being uploaded and compares them with those already installed on the server's GAC.
